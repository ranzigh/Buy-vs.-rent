# Buy-vs.-rent

____________ PURPOSE ____________

This ist a Monte Carlo simulation to decide which is cheaper over the long run - buy or rent. 

The thought is, that your property increases in value and you save the rent, but you have the tradeoff of having repair costs and need to pay interest when taking on a loan.

Rening on the other hand let's you invest your money into stocks or whatever investment opportunities you choose. However you will have to pay your rent for the foreseeable future.

____________ INSTALLATION ____________

Since this is a single Jupyter notebook you just have to have Jupyter installed. Libraries you need to have are Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. 

____________ USAGE ____________

If you want to calculate your own situation, you need to fill in the placeholder values for available money and the price of the flat/house you are aiming to purchase or if you dont have one in mind, just fill in your maximum budget. If your estimations for the other parameters differ from mine, feel free to adjust them aswell. 
The nature of a Monte Carlo simulation however eliminates the need to change the values a bit. You just might want to change the ranges, e.g. for the interest rate or the return of your investments.


____________ NOTES ____________

The values for variables within the program do not represent any real scenario or my real Â´financial situation. I changed the values. I believe, though, the values shown represent a realististic scenario for some people.
