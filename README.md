# Buy-vs.-rent
Monte Carlo Simulation to decide which is cheaper over the long run - buy or rent

The values for variables within the program do not represent any real scenario. I changed the values ;)

You need to fill in the placeholder values for available money and the price of the flat/house you are aiming to purchase or if you dont have one in mind, just fill in your max. budget. If your estimations for the other parameters differ from mine, feel free to adjust them aswell.
